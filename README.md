Semester long software development class code base 

Project Description: 

Design and implement a gaming system that hosts games of Hey, That’s my Fish! and provides a server to which hackers can connect AI players to compete in tournaments. Project implemented from the bottom up starting with game pieces, full game and tournament play, and finally the client/server components. Project completed while fully participating in Northeastern’s key undergraduate software development course without enrolling. Therefore, you will not find CS 4500 on my transcript. With the permission of Professor Felleisen, I partook in this course after being told I had to wait to meet the requirements to. Many undergraduates consider this course the most challenging of their career and I simply did not wish to wait to experience it.


Project highlights:

<ul>
  <li>Semester-long pair programming collaboration</li>
<li>Wrote detailed design documents, defended design choices</li>
<li>Presented two code walks for class of 50 students as well as a 1-hour final code walk with course staff</li>
<li>Integration tests for each milestone; unit tests for each file</li>
<li>A complex tree data structure to lazily generate future game outcomes for strategizing and determining game rules mid-game</li>
<li>Implemented a potential hacker’s AI player-software using the minimax algorithm strategy</li>
<li>Designed and wrote player API protocol documentation</li>
<li>Made design decisions mindful of potential security threats to internal system</li>
<li>Implemented remote-proxy pattern, bringing together the server-side game system and client-side AI players</li>
</ul>
