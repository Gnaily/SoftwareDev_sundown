xyes is a shell executable program that echos command line arguments to standard output. The basic task logic found in the Xyes.java file is to concatenate all command line arguments into one line, separated by a single ASCII spaces, and to display the final output an infinite number of times. If the first command line argument is '-limit', however, the final output will print only 20 times. If the program is run with no command line arguments, the default output line is "hello world."
