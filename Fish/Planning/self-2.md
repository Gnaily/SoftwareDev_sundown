## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 2

A fundamental guideline of Fundamentals I, II, and OOD is to design
methods and functions systematically, starting with a signature, a
clear purpose statement (possibly illustrated with examples), and
unit tests.

Under each of the following elements below, indicate below where your
TAs can find:

- the data description of tiles, including an interpretation:
https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/sundown/blob/6ae14a79c4bf20262f96a825a2a7e18d411ab66e/Fish/Common/src/main/java/com/fish/model/tile/Tile.java#L3-L7

The full description of tiles can be found preceding the Tile interface.

- the data description of boards, include an interpretation:
https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/sundown/blob/6ae14a79c4bf20262f96a825a2a7e18d411ab66e/Fish/Common/src/main/java/com/fish/model/board/HexGameBoard.java#L13-L17

The data description of the board data type can be found preceding the HexGameBoard class declaration. This description includes what information is stored within the class. However, a description of its functionality can be found in the comments for the GameBoard interface:

https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/sundown/blob/6ae14a79c4bf20262f96a825a2a7e18d411ab66e/Fish/Common/src/main/java/com/fish/model/board/GameBoard.java#L10-L16

- the functionality for removing a tile:
  - purpose: no purpose statement

  - signature: https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/sundown/blob/6ae14a79c4bf20262f96a825a2a7e18d411ab66e/Fish/Common/src/main/java/com/fish/model/board/HexGameBoard.java#L209

  - unit tests:https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/sundown/blob/6ae14a79c4bf20262f96a825a2a7e18d411ab66e/Fish/Common/src/test/java/com/fish/model/board/HexGameBoardTest.java#L163-L198

- the functiinality for reaching other tiles on the board:
  - purpose: no purpose statement

  - signature: https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/sundown/blob/6ae14a79c4bf20262f96a825a2a7e18d411ab66e/Fish/Common/src/main/java/com/fish/model/board/HexGameBoard.java#L122

  - unit tests: https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/sundown/blob/6ae14a79c4bf20262f96a825a2a7e18d411ab66e/Fish/Common/src/test/java/com/fish/model/board/HexGameBoardTest.java#L81-L138

The ideal feedback is a GitHub perma-link to the range of lines in specific
file or a collection of files for each of the above bullet points.

  WARNING: all such links must point to your commit "6ae14a79c4bf20262f96a825a2a7e18d411ab66e".
  Any bad links will result in a zero score for this self-evaluation.
  Here is an example link:
    <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/sundown/tree/6ae14a79c4bf20262f96a825a2a7e18d411ab66e/Fish>

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

In either case you may wish to, beneath each snippet of code you
indicate, add a line or two of commentary that explains how you think
the specified code snippets answers the request.
