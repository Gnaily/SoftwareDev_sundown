## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 1

### General 

We will run self-evaluations for each milestone this semester.  The
graders will evaluate them for accuracy and completeness.

Every self-evaluation will go out into your Enterprise GitHub repo
within a short time afrer the milestone deadline, and you will have 24
hours to answer the questions and push back a completed form.

This one is a practice run to make sure you get


### Specifics 


- does your analysis cover the following ideas:

  - the need for an explicit Interface specification between the (remote) AI 
    players and the game system?

No, we mention players can connect via AI but do not specify that we need an interface for this interaction.

  - the need for a referee sub-system for managing individual games

Yes. This can be found in the second sentence of the Gameplay paragraph.

  - the need for a tournament management sub-system for grouping
    players into games and dispatching to referee components

We specify the need for a tournament management system in the tournament component paragraph, however 
we do not specify dispatching games to the referee.

- does your building plan identify concrete milestones with demo prototypes:

  - for running individual games

Our first milestone is to be able to play a single game of fish on one computer.


  - for running complete tournaments on a single computer 

We do not mention running a complete tournament on one computer.


  - for running remote tournaments on a network

Milestone 4 (tournament completion) is the full networking demo of running a server-based tournament.



- for the English of your memo, you may wish to check the following:

  - is each paragraph dedicated to a single topic? does it come with a
    thesis statement that specifies the topic?

Yes. Each paragraph is preceded by a bolded topic.


  - do sentences make a point? do they run on?

Yes, our sentences are succinct.


  - do sentences connect via old words/new words so that readers keep
    reading?

Yes.


  - are all sentences complete? Are they missing verbs? Objects? Other
    essential words?

Yes, we checked our memos for grammar mistakes.

  - did you make sure that the spelling is correct? ("It's" is *not* a
    possesive; it's short for "it is". "There" is different from
    "their", a word that is too popular for your generation.)

Our spelling is correct.

The ideal feedback are pointers to specific senetences in your memo.
For PDF, the paragraph/sentence number suffices. 

For **code repos**, we will expect GitHub line-specific links.
